I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at Penn State, supervised by [Dr. Ting Wang](https://alps-lab.github.io/). 
Before joining Penn State, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Tianjin University and my Master's degree from Zhejiang University. My research interests include adversarial machine learning, large language models, and deepfake detection.
