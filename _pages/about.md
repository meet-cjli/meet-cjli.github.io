I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at Penn State, supervised by [Dr. Ting Wang](https://alps-lab.github.io/). 
Before joining Penn State, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Tianjin University and my Master's degree from Zhejiang University. My research interests include adversarial machine learning, .

in the College of Computer Science and Technology at the Zhejiang University in 2022, supervised by Prof. Shouling Ji. During Ph.D., I have spent wonderful times in collaborating with academics at the university (e.g., Prof. Bo Li at UIUC, and Prof. Ting Wang at PSU), and researchers in the industrial community (e.g., Dr. Tao Wei at Baidu USA (now Ant Financial), Dr. Jie Shi at Huawei Singapore Research Center). Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree in the Communication Engineering at the College of Information Science and Techonology, Xiamen University.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
