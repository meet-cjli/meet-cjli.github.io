I am currently a final year Ph.D. student at Stony Brook University, supervised by [Dr. Ting Wang](https://alps-lab.github.io/).  Prior to transferring to Stony Brook in 2023, I was a Ph.D. candidate at Penn State. I earned my Bachelor's degree from Tianjin University and my Master's degree from Zhejiang University (supervised by [Dr. Shouling Ji](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/webpage/crew/jsl.html)). My research interests encompass adversarial machine learning, large language models, and deepfake detection.
